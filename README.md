Your Character must have a constructor taking its name as a parameter. Any copy
(using copy constructor or copy assignment operator) of a Character must be deep.
During copy, the Materias of a Character must be deleted before the new ones are added
to their inventory. Of course, the Materias must be deleted when a Character is destroyed.
